This HTML document creates a simple interactive web page that allows users to dynamically insert and delete rows in a table using JavaScript.
The page displays a styled table initially populated with five rows and two columns, and includes two buttons labeled "Insert row" and "Delete row.
" When the "Insert row" button is clicked, a new row is added to the bottom of the table with dynamically generated content, while the "Delete row" button removes the first row from the table body. 
If all rows are deleted, a message is displayed notifying the user that there are no more rows to delete. The layout is enhanced with basic CSS for borders, spacing, and button styling.
A small syntax error in the insertRow() function (missing backticks for template literals) should be corrected for the row content to display properly. 
Overall, the code demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and styling techniques suitable for learning purposes or lab assignments.
